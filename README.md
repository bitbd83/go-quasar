# Quasar Chain – Qusar
### v1.0.0-stable

## Introduction to the Quasar Open Platform
The Quasar Open Platform is a unified infrastructure platform based on the technical, traffic and ecological resources of the Quasar Group, and will be gradually open to the blockchain industry. It will make the construction of decentralized applications more efficient and cost-effective, and provide comprehensive empowerment in aspects of promotion, traffic, and resources. In December 2020, the first product of the Quasar Open Platform, the Quasar ECO Chain, also known as Quasar, officially launched its "Tinder" phase. In addition, Quasar Open Platform will launch DEX and other blockchain infrastructures based on Layer 2. The Quasar Open Platform will provide global developers with series of diverse innovative facilities and services.

## Introduction to Quasar ECO Chain
Quasar Chain – Qusar is a decentralized, high-efficiency and energy-saving public chain, also the first product launched by the Quasar Open Platform. It is compatible with smart contracts and supports high-performance transactions. The endogenous token of Quasar is HT and it adopts the HPoS consensus mechanism. Quasar will continue to improve the efficiency of Ethereum by Layer2, which will supplement and empower the Ethereum ecosystem.

## Declaration
To help developers’ evolvement at every stage


## Quasar’s Performance
- TPS: 750+
- Average block interval: 9s

## Consensus Mechanism
HPoS consensus mechanism: it has the characteristics of low transaction cost, low transaction delay, and high transaction concurrency.

The maximum number of validators supported is 21.

## Economic Model
The endogenous token on the chain is HT; the transactions consume HT as gas fee.

Miners pledge HT to become validator nodes. The reward of nodes is gas fee, which is distributed according to the mortgage proportion.

## Cross-Chain
Assets such as BTC, ETH and stable coins can be mapped to Quasar by an asset bridge. The realization method is to lock a certain amount of tokens on the original chain then generate a corresponding number of tokens on Quasar.

Quasar encourages developers to provide more decentralized cross-chain solution.

## Meta Transaction Function
The meta-transaction function is supported, which allows users to reduce gas fees step-wise, and Quasar will cover the payment of the reduced part. The meta-transaction function allows to minimize the migration cost of DApp developers, as well as to effectively reduce the cost of DApp users.

## Quasar Technical Characteristics
- An open and decentralized network to maintain the security of the network and assets.
- Support the programmability of EVM, the compatibility of smart contracts to reduce development or migration costs.
- Meta-transaction function: gas fee reduction, effectively reducing the cost of developers and users on the chain.
- Support cross-chain asset transfer to optimize users’ experience.


## Risk Warning
- All users and developers can participate in the current test environment and subsequent stages of Quasar for free, and there is no charging scenario.
- All users must distinguish the test environment from the Mainnet. The assets generated in the test environment have no value. Be aware of counterfeit currency fraud.
- Quasar announces authorization, promotion and other collaborations only through the official social media platform. Developers and users should check carefully to avoid losses.
- Do not misread the official website (Quasarchain.org), and be cautious with private key phishing.
